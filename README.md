# README

## Welcome to Limbo!

Limbo is an app designed to help users make either/or decisions. _"Should I wear the red shirt or the blue shirt?" "What kind of cheese should I buy?"_ Once a question is submitted with a desired 'deadline' and optional context, other users in the community can vote on which option they see more fit. If a user wants a more in depth answer or discussion, Limbo provides a discussion section that acts almost as a forum.

A prototype of Limbo is currently hosted on Heroku and available for use [here](https://powerful-cliffs-92765.herokuapp.com/).

## Installation

Limbo was built using ruby 2.3.3 and rails 5, though it will likely work with Ruby 2.1 and 2.2, as well as future versions.

To use Limbo, clone it and perform the following:
* run `bundle install`
* run `rake db:migrate`
* that's it!

Since this is a social-ish app, and works better with a community feel, there is some seed data included in order to give you a feel for how the populated site would function. Run `rake db:seed` to get the site populated.

## Using Limbo

A video of intended usage can be found [here](https://youtu.be/DIhTcSCIjts).
Or you can just use it yourself [here](https://powerful-cliffs-92765.herokuapp.com).
