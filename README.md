## Welcome to Limbo!

Limbo is an app designed to help users make either/or decisions. _"Should I wear the red shirt or the blue shirt?" "What kind of cheese should I buy?"_ These are the questions we ask, and these are the questions we want answers for. If you want a more in depth answer or discussion, Limbo provides a discussion section that acts almost as a forum.

##Installation

Limbo was built using ruby 2.3.3 and rails 5, though it will likely work with Ruby 2.1 and 2.2, as well as future versions.

To use Limbo, clone it and perform the following:
* run `bundle install`
* run `rake db:migrate`
* run `rake db:seed`
Since this is a social app, there is some seed data included in order to give you a feel for how the populated site would function.
